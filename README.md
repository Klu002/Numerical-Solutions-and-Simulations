# Numerical-Solutions-and-Simulations
A collection of numerical solutions and stimulations using them, written in Python. 
We begin with basic finite difference methods to approximate the canoniocal linear PDEs such as transport, wave, etc
Luckily, even with just those PDEs we have an amazing range of modeling that can be done starting with the conservation equation. See FDM_Examples for some modeling projects.
